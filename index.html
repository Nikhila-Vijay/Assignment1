            <div class="welcome1">
                <div>
                    <p>Palakkad is rightfully known as the Gateway of Kerala, giving the rest of India access to the State. Its other name is 
                    Palghat was contributed by British Raj. 
                    Palakkad is a land of palm trees and paddy fields. 
                    It's known to be rich in flora and fauna.Palakkad was also known as Palakkattussery. 
                    Some etymologists trace the word "Palakkad" from the word Palai nilam, which means "dry lands". 
                    The commonly held belief, however, is 
                    that the name is a fusion of two words, Pala, a tree that is found abundantly in Palakkad,
                    and Kadu, which means forest.
                    </p>

                    <p>Palakkad is prime among Kerala's most picturesque districts, 
                    thanks to its distinctive palmyra trees and extensive green paddy fields. 
                    Palakkad lies near the Palghat Gap, a pass or natural depression through the Western Ghats ranges
                     that run parallel to the west coast of India, and connects Kerala to the plains of the state of
                      Tamil Nadu to the east.
                    The Silent Valley National Park that abruptly rises to the Nilgiris is an everlasting marvel to the tourists.

                <h2>History Of Palakkad:</h2>
            </div>
            <div class="history1">
                <p>The ancient history of Palakkad is shrouded in mystery. According to William Logan, the author of the Malabar Manual, the Pallava dynasty of Kanchi might have invaded Malabar in the second or third century AD. One of their headquarters was a place called ‘Palakada’ which could be the present-day Palakkad. Malabar had been invaded by many of the ancient South Indian rulers. For many centuries it was ruled by Perumals. They had under them some powerful ‘Utayavars’ who held authority in their respective territories. 
                    After the rule of Perumals, the country was divided among these chieftains. 
                    The Valluvakonathiri (ruler of Valluvanad), the rulers of Vengunad (Kollengodu Rajas) and Sekharivarma 
                    Rajas of Palakkad were the prominent rulers of this region after the Perumals.

                    When the Zamorin of Calicut invaded Palakkad in 1757, the Raja of Palakkad
                     sought the help of Hyder Ali of Mysore. Hyder Ali’s help forced the Zamorin to retreat. 
                     Later, Hyder Ali subjugated all territories in Palakkad which were under the possession of Zamorin.
                      Thus the whole area possessed by the Raja of Palghat passed into the hands of the Mysore rulers,
                       Hyder Ali and his son Tippu. The war between Tippu and the East India Company ended with the treaty of 
                       1872 and all the possessions of Tippu in Malabar were ceded to the British. Gradually these formed part of
                        the Malabar district of the Madras presidency.</p>
